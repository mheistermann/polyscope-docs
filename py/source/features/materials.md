Polyscope uses *matcaps* to render the appearance of objects in the scene, as opposed to more traditional configurations of lights and shading models, etc. A matcap is a small image of a material, which is sampled by the renderer to query the materials' appearance from a some angle. Scene information like lighting is implicitly baked in to the matcap image.

Most objects in Polyscope (surface meshes, point clouds, vectors, etc) expose a `#!python material='matname'` option to choose a material for the object's appearance. Additionally, materials can generally be set in the UI from `[Options] --> [Material]`.

## Blended materials

In Polyscope, we often want to adjust set custom colors for rendered objects. This can be a constant color for the object (to distinguish structures in a scene), or a varying color across a surface (when color-mapping scalar quantities).  Traditionally, matcaps don't really support setting an albedo color like this, but we achieve the effect in Polyscope by blending between basis matcaps.

???+ info "How it works"

    Instead of just using a single material image, we take four images of the material, representing basis red, green, blue, and black components.

    ![sample colormap]([[url.prefix]]/media/materials/clay_r.jpg){: style="height:150px;"}
    ![sample colormap]([[url.prefix]]/media/materials/clay_g.jpg){: style="height:150px;"}
    ![sample colormap]([[url.prefix]]/media/materials/clay_b.jpg){: style="height:150px;"}
    ![sample colormap]([[url.prefix]]/media/materials/clay_k.jpg){: style="height:150px;"}

    At runtime, to generate a color from a triple of `rgb` values each in the range `[0,1]`, we sample the images like:

    ```
    outputColor = r * basis_r + g * basis_g + b * basis_b + (1. - r - g - b) * basis_k
    ```

    Intuitively, this strategy presumes the underlying material has a light response which is a linear function of the color, plus another component which is independent of the color.  Crucially, Polyscope uses a linear lighting workflow and performs this blending on linear matcaps before tone-mapping, which is necessary for the results to look reasonable across the full color space.

Materials which which support this blending are denoted by `(rgb)` in the options menu.  Ordinary static matcaps consisting of a single image can still be used as materials, but will ignore any color maps or other options.

## Preserving colors with the flat material

Generally, Polyscope applies material shading and tone-mapping to render 3D content. However, this means that data such as colors and tonemapped scalars will be a somewhat different color on-screen compared to what is in the data.

The `flat` material is special: it not only applies flat coloring with no shading effects, but furthermore cancels-out tonemapping and other effects to ensure that the color you see onscreen is exactly the same as the data specified.

Use the `flat` material any time you need exact color reproduction.

## Built-in materials

Polyscope supports the following built-in materials:

| **Name** | **String Key** |  **Blendable** | Image |
--- | --- | --- | ---
clay | `clay` | yes | ![clay image]([[url.prefix]]/media/materials/clay_r.jpg){: style="width:100px;"}
wax | `wax` | yes | ![wax image]([[url.prefix]]/media/materials/wax_r.jpg){: style="width:100px;"}
candy | `candy` | yes | ![candy image]([[url.prefix]]/media/materials/candy_r.jpg){: style="width:100px;"}
flat | `flat` | yes | ![flat image]([[url.prefix]]/media/materials/flat_r.jpg){: style="width:100px;"}
mud[^1] | `mud` | no | ![mud image]([[url.prefix]]/media/materials/mud.jpg){: style="width:100px;"}
ceramic[^1] | `ceramic` | no | ![ceramic image]([[url.prefix]]/media/materials/ceramic.jpg){: style="width:100px;"}
jade[^1] | `jade` | no | ![jade image]([[url.prefix]]/media/materials/jade.jpg){: style="width:100px;"}
normal[^1] | `normal` | no | ![normal image]([[url.prefix]]/media/materials/normal.jpg){: style="width:100px;"}

## Loading custom materials

Custom matcaps can be loaded at runtime from image files and used anywhere materials are used. Loading can be performed with the UI from `[Appearance] --> [Materials] --> [Load material]`, or programatically using the function below. For blendable matcaps, if the single filename `mat.hdr` is given, Polyscope will try to load `mat_r.hdr`, `mat_g.hdr`, etc.

Ideally, matcap images should be linear `.hdr` images for best results, but any image will work. If other image formats are given, the input is assumed to be non-linear and will be inverse-tonemapped with `intensity=1` and `gamma=2.2` before use.  Most common image formats are accepted (anything `stb_image` can read).

??? func "`#!python load_static_material(mat_name, filename)`"

    ##### load_static_material

    Load a new static (non-blendable) material from a single image file `filename`. The new material will be called `mat_nam`.

    Example:
    ```python
    import polyscope as ps

    ps.load_static_material("fancy mat", "my_image.png")
    ```


??? func "`#!python load_blendable_material(mat_name, filenames=None, filename_base=None, filename_ext=None)`"

    ##### load_blendable_material

    Load a new blendable material, which will be called `matName`.

    There are two different ways to specify which files to load the material images from:

    - Specify `filenames`, a tuple of four string filenames corresponding to red, green, blue, and black basis materials
    - Specify `filename_base`, and `filename_ext`, to generate the four filenames as `filename_base + "_r" + filename_ext`, etc.

    Example:
    ```python
    import polyscope as ps

    ps.load_blendable_material("fancy blendable mat", filenames = (
                                "my_image_r.png",
                                "my_image_g.png",
                                "my_image_b.png",
                                "my_image_k.png"
                              ))

    # OR

    ps.load_blendable_material("fancy blendable mat", filename_base="my_image", filename_ext=".png")
    ```
