- **Version 2.0.0** Apr, 2023  
    - **Breaking:** Rename `intrinsic` vector quantities to `tangent`. Change interpretation of symmetric data. Track bases per-quantity rather than per-structure.

- **Version 1.3.0** Dec 1, 2021 `8e692da` Adds high-performance mode for big point clouds, volume mesh inspection with slice planes, more slice plane config options, better control of structure transformations and scene extents, orthographic view, back face coloring options, advanced options for customizing ImGui, support for shared linking, and bug fixes.
- **Version 1.2.0** July 29, 2021`6b3cc34` Add volume meshes, slice planes, and transparent rendering. Support soft ground shadows, point clouds with variable radius, and back face culling options for surface meshes. Better programmatic camera controls. Generalize isoline support for all scalar quantities. Change the font.  Overhaul to a more flexible shader system, internally, change default screenshot format back to `png`, fix size validation bugs with surface mesh, require explicit tangent spaces.
- **Version 1.1.0** `107930b` Mar 30, 2020: Select backend at runtime, improve backend support in build system,  keep window invisible until first show, bugfixes, add Windows builds to CI.
- **Version 1.0.0** `6f44d1a` Mar 25, 2020: Overhaul rendering backend, generalize materials, raycast vectors and cylinders, linear lighting workflow, custom matcaps, mocked backend, general unit tests.
- **Jan 29, 2020** `92b45be`: Many bugfixes, small features, and general API cleanup.  Encapsulate parameters for structures and quantities.  Use scaled values and persistent values to track parameters.  Additional camera navigation controls.  Simplify picking API.
- **Sept 19, 2019** `2f83da2`: Add streamline visualization for vector fields (previously existed but was removed)
- **Aug 11, 2019** `dd4b36f`: Add curve network quantity.
- **July 20, 2019** `afe7c5e`: Add helpers for 2D visualization. Move templates on structure constructors for consistency.
- **July 18, 2019** `8514792`: Completely-rewritten Polyscope version 2.0 released. This new version is decoupled from any particular geometry codebase, and is designed to be easy to integrate with existing projects.
